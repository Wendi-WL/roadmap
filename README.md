# Roadmap Personal Project

## Introduction

The application is a **Roadmap** to track progress towards long-term **Objectives** and short-term **Goals**, 
as well as the completion of related **Tasks**.

The application is coded in Python and uses design-driven development. The project is managed using Poetry. 

## Current Status of Project

The roadmap's current GUI allows for the creation of Objectives, Categories, Phases, Goals, and sub-Goals/Tasks. 
The basic details of these objects can be set upon creation and viewed in the GUI.

Future updates will allow for the deletion of such objects as well as features such as progress and completion tracking,
which have not yet been implemented in the GUI.
